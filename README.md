# nodejs-express-mysql-project

In this project, I created a CRUD web app using HTML5, CSS, Node.js, Express and MySQL to create display of a list of employees.

CRUD:

- Create - Add a new employee by name.
- Read - View a list of employee data.
- Update - Clicking edit and updating an employee name.
- Delete - Clicking delete to remove an employee from the table.
